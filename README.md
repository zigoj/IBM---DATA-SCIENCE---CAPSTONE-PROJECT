# IBM---DATA-SCIENCE---CAPSTONE-PROJECT

This is the final project of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The aim of the project is to apply the knowledge gathered throughout the course. 


# Project Background

SpaceX is the most successful company of the commercial space age, making space travel affordable. The company advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, 
with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 
Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. Based on public information and machine learning models,
I am going to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.

# Project Deliverables

Examine what impact have various features such as payload mass, launch site, orbits and the number of flights on successful landing of the first stage. 
Find the best machine learning algorithm for the parameters in order to be able to improve success rate and reusability of the first stage going forward.  
How does the success rate evolve over time?

# My approach:
	Data Collection
	Data Wrangling
	Exploratory Data Analysis
	Data Visualization 
	Building a Dashboard with Plotly Dash
	Predictive Analysis
	Conclusion
